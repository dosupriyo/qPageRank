This repository contains the Python programs used in the numerical experiments available in the article "Discrete-Time Open Quantum Walks for Vertex Ranking in Graphs" (arXiv:2404.14770).

To write these programs I used an I7 processor with 64 GB RAM, and Anaconda (conda 4.12.0) software in Ubuntu (Ubuntu 22.04.4 LTS) operating system.

You may download the Python notebooks available here and run them on your computer.

Check the latest realese for the latest updated programs.
