This repository contains the Python programs used in the numerical experiments available in the article "Discrete-Time Open Quantum Walks for Vertex Ranking in Graphs" (arXiv:2404.14770).

To write these programs I used an I3 processor with 4 GB RAM, and Anaconda (conda 4.12.0) software in Ubuntu (Ubuntu 22.04.4 LTS) operating system. You may collect Anaconda from https://www.anaconda.com/.

You may download the Python notebooks available here and run them on your computer.
